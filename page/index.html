                Word cloud graph of the lost games draws a very different picture. Notably prevalent is the word 'report' and 'end'. This obviously is a very clear sign of toxicity and flaming your teammates. So if you want to win more games, focus on your own game and try staying positive! Might be difficult at first but it will reward you with more wins!! and This refers to the reporting functionality which is present in the game. You can report players to the game developer company in case they have behaved in either toxic manner, not been playing or have cheated. Often players in the losing teams want to report their own team members for not performing up to the reporting player's standards.
