                Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena video game (MOBA). MOBA is an extremely popular genre which spans across numerous widely played titles. It's also a very competitive format. This makes it attractive from a financial perspective, as tournament prize pools are large and numerous betting sites offer opportunities for quick monetary gains. As is the case for any profitable endeavour, helping the aspirants to achieve their goals can also be very lucrative. Thus we present our analysis of the most important factors of winning a game of Dota 2. This information is useful for both the players and anyone interested to predict match results.

                Players have the possibility of using an in-game chat function during their games. Dota 2 also includes a voice chat option, but that is left out in this analysis due to the technical difficulty. Chat messages can be sent either just to the players of your own team or to everyone. We were interested to find out whether the nature of your chat messages would reflect the result of the matches. Note to the reader: being negative during the game is generally defined as toxicity (or being toxic).

                Word cloud graph of the lost games draws a very different picture. Notably prevalent is the word report. This refers to the reporting functionality which is present in the game. You can report players to the game developer company in case they have behaved in either toxic manner, not been playing or have cheated. Often players in the losing teams want to report their own team members for not performing up to the reporting player's standards.
