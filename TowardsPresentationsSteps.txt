Next Steps

- We keep downloading the data(1GB already in, keeps working on Uula's machine)
- We already have script that splits hero ids into binary variables
- in TPOT we trust, probably on Burak's machine
- Clean the players data and do the necessary transformations


- Word clouds for general idea on winning and losing
- A separate tab in the website for the prediction tool so people can enter their values and check their winning chance
- Check if we can find average values for different ranks so we can show the difference for the winning averages on the website
- Jst show the values in the order of importance towards winning
